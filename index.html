      <p1 class="directions"><br><br><br>Welcome to the TPMS commemorative escape room game! This game is created and presented by Maya Evans, Grace Doughty, Kieran Ferguson and Solomon Gold. <br> <br> Starting at one of the first floor classrooms, you travel the school in a firsthand experience to four of the most iconic classrooms of the Magnet experience. 
        Traveling through these rooms will be a test of your patience, meme knowledge and street smarts as you play to escape these classrooms. <br> <br>How to play:
        Before each escape room you will receive a hint in the form of a Wake-Up Takoma announcement. This hint will tell you which classroom to go to. Once in the classroom, your job is to click on items or places you see in the room, solve the puzzles, and escape!
        Once you solve the final problem, you will receive a key from the room, something memorable from that teacher. Once you have collected all the keys, you will graduate and be set free from the school!
        <br> <br>Click on the button below for your first hint.</p1>
